# eggbot-serial-patch

This is for my own documentation of what I did to get eggbot to run on my Mac in 2024. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SgNhhwtqVc for the result. 
What you can try is taking the latest Inkscape, installing Axis-Draw and replacing ebb_serial.py with this version. I added some debug output to the inkscape console in the file. Have a look and see if some serial port is found. 
I have and give no guarantee that this will work for you. .
